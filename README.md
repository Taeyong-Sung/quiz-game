Lets play a fun quiz game! The goal for this quiz is to score above 3!

> ## Motivation/Inspiration:
Pokemon has always been a childhood favorite of mine. I vividly recall the times I used my Nintendo DS beneath my covers to play Pokemon with a flashlight. Since I was a kid, I had a lot of enjoyable memories from playing Pokemon.
