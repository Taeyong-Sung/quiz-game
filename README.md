Lets play a fun quiz game! The goal for this simple quiz is to score above 3!

> ## Motivation/Inspiration:
Since I was a child, playing quizzes online has been one of my favorite pastimes. My friends and I used to enjoy exchanging questions and answers. Seeing what other people knew about anything in the world compared to what I knew about anything was really exciting.
