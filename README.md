Lets play a fun quiz game! The goal for this quiz is to score above 3!

> ## Motivation/Inspiration:
Since I can remember, one of my favorite games has always been quizzes. I have always been curious to learn more about the world. Additionally, I have always loved Pokemon, even as a child. I still remember the days I played Pokemon with a flashlight on my Nintendo DS while hiding under my blankets. Playing Pokemon brought back many happy memories for me as a child.
